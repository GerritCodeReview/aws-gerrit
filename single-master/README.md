# Gerrit Single Master

This set of Templates provide all the components to deploy a single Gerrit master
in ECS

## Architecture

Three templates are provided in this example:
* `cf-cluster`: define the ECS cluster and the networking stack
* `cf-service`: defined the service stack running Gerrit
* `cf-dns-route`: defined the DNS routing for the service

### Networking

* Single VPC:
 * CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
* Single Availability Zone
* 1 public Subnets:
 * CIDR: 10.0.0.0/24
* 1 public NLB exposing:
 * HTTP on port 8080
 * SSH on port 29418
* 1 Internet Gateway
* 1 type A alias DNS entry
* A SSL certificate available in [AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/)

### Data persistency

* EBS volumes for:
  * Indexes
  * Caches
  * Data
  * Git repositories

### Deployment type

* Latest Gerrit version deployed using the official [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/gerritcodereview/gerrit)
* Application deployed in ECS on a single EC2 instance

### Logging

* Gerrit `error_log` is exported in a Log Group in CloudWatch
* Other Gerrit logs still need to be exported

### Monitoring

* Standard CloudWatch monitoring metrics for each component
* Prometheus and Grafana stack is not available for this recipe yet. However the work has been done for
the dual-master recipe and it could be easily adapted (you can find the relevant issue
[here](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13092)).

## How to run it

You can find [on GerritForge's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr2zCSuclIU) a
step-by-step guide on how to setup you Gerrit Code Review in AWS.

However, keep reading this guide for a more exhaustive explanation.

### 0 - Prerequisites

Follow the steps described in the [Prerequisites](../Prerequisites.md) section

### 1 - Configuration

Please refer to the [configuration docs](../Configuration.md) to understand how to set up the
configuration and what common configuration values are needed.
On top of that, you might set the additional parameters, specific for this recipe.

#### Environment

Configuration values affecting deployment environment and cluster properties

* `SERVICE_STACK_NAME`: Optional. Name of the service stack. `gerrit-service` by default.
* Create the cluster, service and DNS routing stacks:

```
make [AWS_REGION=a-valid-aws-region] [AWS_PREFIX=some-cluster-prefix] create-all
```

The optional `AWS_REGION` and `AWS_REFIX` allow you to define where it will be deployed and what it will be named.

It might take several minutes to build the stack.
You can monitor the creations of the stacks in [CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home)

* *NOTE*: the creation of the cluster needs an EC2 key pair are useful when you need to connect
to the EC2 instances for troubleshooting purposes. The key pair is automatically generated
and stored in a `pem` file on the current directory.
To use when ssh-ing into your instances as follow: `ssh -i cluster-keys.pem ec2-user@<ec2_instance_ip>`

### Cleaning up

```
make [AWS_REGION=a-valid-aws-region] [AWS_PREFIX=some-cluster-prefix] delete-all
```

The optional `AWS_REGION` and `AWS_REFIX` allow you to specify exactly which stack you target for deletion.

Note that this will *not* delete:
* Secrets stored in Secret Manager
* SSL certificates
* ECR repositories

### Access your Gerrit

You Gerrit instance will be available at this URL: `http://<HOSTED_ZONE_NAME>.<SUBDOMAIN>`.

The available ports are `8080` for HTTP and `29418` for SSH.

### External Services

If you need to setup some external services (maybe for testing purposes, such as SMTP or LDAP),
you can follow the instructions [here](../README.md#external-services)

### Docker

Refer to the [Docker](../Docker.md) section for information on how to setup docker or how to publish images
