      "message": "There are some assumptions and decisions I took when implementing this.\nI would like to double-check those with you:\n\nWhat do you think about basing scaling of replicas on CPU usage, like I did? Is it.a good metric? Would memory or network out be better?\n\nAnother option would be to base the scaling on some *app metric* (we use cloudwatch metrics, so we could base it on some gerrit specific behaviour)\n\nWhat do you think about tracking policy for scaling: (i.e. the attempt to make a specific metric near to a certain value).\nWould Step policy be better?
