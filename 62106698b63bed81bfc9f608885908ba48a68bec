      "message": "Yes, exactly my thinking was that \"multi-site\" recipe will just be two deployments of dual-master with replication and multi-site capabilities.\n\nAs in, if you have another gerrit site somewhere (which possibly you deployed using the same recipe, in a different region), you can \"point\" to it.\n\nThis change allows to be \"pointed to\" by exposing a replication service.\nThe next one allows to \"point to\" by configuring the replication.config accordingly.\n\nThen on top of this we\u0027ll need another CR to configure multi-site plugins and that should be it.\n\nHope it makes sense.",
