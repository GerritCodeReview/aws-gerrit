      "message": "I believe it is relevant to the separation of master from slaves.\n\nHopefully my other comment explains why this is the case, but the bottom line is this:\n\nDesiredCapacity describes the size of the overall cluster: This doesn\u0027t have the right granularity as the size needs to be specific to the different ASG.\n\nWe had a similar conversation when we split master from slaves for the dual-master recipe, this is the porting of the result of that conversation to the master-slave recipe.\n\nHope it makes sense ðŸ˜Š",
