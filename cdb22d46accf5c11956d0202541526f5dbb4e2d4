      "message": "\u003e \u003e \u003e If that was the case, why we didn\u0027t have a fixed number of EC2 instances before?\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e Because depending on the spec of Gerrit you might have wanted/needed more EC2 instances to host them:\n\u003e \u003e - If you deployed masters with very low ram/cpu needs, for example, then perhaps 2 instances would have been enough (to host masters,haproxy,slaves), whilst if you needed more resources for Gerrit, you might have wanted more ec2 instances to allow them to be allocated.\n\u003e \n\u003e I don\u0027t get it. If you had two masters, how allocating 6 EC2 would have given more resources?\n\n\n\nImagine these are the specs defined for your deployment\n\n* Master Service *\nGerrit:\n- Memory: 6Gb\n- Cpu: 1024 (1 vCPU)\n\n* Replica Service *\nGerrit:\n- Memory: 6Gb\n- Cpu: 1024 (1 vCPU)\n\nGit daemon:\n- Memory: 512Mb\n- Cpu: 256 (0.25 vCPU)\n\nGit SSH:\n- Memory: 512Mb\n- Cpu: 256 (0.25 vCPU)\n\n* Loadbalancer service *\n\nha-proxy:\n- Memory: 2Gb\n- Cpu: 1024 (1 vCPU)\n\nTotal Memory needed: (6Gb x 2) + (6Gb + 512Mb + 512Mb) + 2Gb \u003d 19Gb\nTotal CPU needed:   (1024 x 2) + (1024 + 256 + 256)    + 1024 \u003d 4608 (~ 5vCPUs)\n\nNow, let\u0027s assume your you have chosen a cluster EC2 instance type of\n\nm4.xlarge: 4 vCPUs, 16 Gb RAM\n\nYou will need a desired number of instances of _at least_ \u00272\u0027: if you had \u00271\u0027 you wouldn\u0027t have room for 19Gb and 5 vCPUs.\n\nIf you changed your gerrit specs to be higher however, you might need a cluster of 3, and so on.\n\nThe number of instances in the cluster is a function of _needed resources_, not just of _number of instances_.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003e \n\u003e I believe before it was more forward thinking, allowing the next iterations of this recipe to have more horsepower. Remember that we still need to add additional components:\n\u003e - Git daemon\n\u003e - Git/SSH\n\n\n\n^^^ These are already part of the replica service\n\n\n\n\n\u003e - JGit GC node\n\n\n\nNot sure this one will need to be a component: it is an operational task and it could be modelled as a ECS daemon[1], or a step function, or SSM, or a lambda, etc.\n\n\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e \u003e Also, the ASG is for the EC2 instances of the ECS cluster, and not for *exclusively* the master node.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e Not anymore, we have 3 ASGs in the cluster at the moment (master, replica, haproxy) and the \"desired number of instances\" is not a property of the ECS cluster, but rather a property of the ASG.\n\u003e \n\u003e Aren\u0027t the 3 ASGs part of the ECS cluster, just with different labels?\n\nYes, they are 3 ASGs _registered_ to the same ECS cluster.\n\n\u003e We can of course have 2 settings now:\n\u003e - Desired number of masters\u0027 EC2 instances\n\u003e - Desired number of WLB EC2 instances\n\n\n\nWhat\u0027s a WLB? Worker?\n\n\n\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Depending on how many many containers you want in each ASG, you may want different number of instances.\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e There are 3 different ASG that could potentially be tuned with [min-desired-max], one for each ASG.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e * haproxy -\u003e this should go to a 2-2-n (as per your point in the previous CR, I will raise the relevant change)\n\u003e \n\u003e N should be configurable\n\n\n\nYes agreed, I\u0027ll raise an issue for this.\n\n\n\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e * master -\u003e this should be 1-1-1, always, because masters cannot scale.\n\u003e \n\u003e Nope, you would need extra horsepower for additional components, as I mentioned.\n\n\nI believe the extra components are there already (if you mean the ones for replicas). If not, which other components do you mean?\n\n\n\u003e Also, when you do blue/green deployments, I imagine that ECS would do:\n\u003e a. Create the new task\n\u003e b. Wait for the task to be healthy\n\u003e c. Kill the old task\n\u003e \n\u003e If you have only 1 fixed EC2 instance, it may actually fail to do the upgrades with blue/green deployments.\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e * replica -\u003e this should be 1-1-1 until we introduce EFS that allow them to scale.\n\u003e \n\u003e Why? Replicas are intended to be scaled up, as they are stateless. This is exactly the point where we want to have the maximum number of instances as a parameter.\n\u003e \n\u003e We do have already the parameter for allowing them to scale up, I can understand the point of making it 3 parameters, which is fair. I don\u0027t get the point of hardcoding the maximum values, as they are not hardcoded now.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u0027s say we scaled replicas to 3 instances.\nNow we have a NLB, with a targetGroup containing 3 replicas running on 3 different EC2 instances, each one having its own independent git data (on EBS).\n\nWhen masters replicate to the replica NLB, only _one_ of the 3 will receive the update, leaving the other ones behind.\n\nWhat\u0027s the point of increasing the number of replicas before we have an EFS to share across them?\n\n\n[1] https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/06/amazon-ecs-adds-daemon-scheduling/",
