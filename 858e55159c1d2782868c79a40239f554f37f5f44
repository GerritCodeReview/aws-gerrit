      "message": "\u003e We already use Cloudwatch anyway, correct? Is CloudWatch more expensive than running the EC2 instances of Grafana/Prometheus?\n\nIt depends on how big are the ec2 instances and how frequently are metrics sent. It _can_ be cheaper. Cloudwatch is notoriously expensive.\n\n\u003e Sure, but I\u0027ll park this change for now. If we remove Prometheus/Grafana, we don\u0027t need it right?\n\nAt the moment the \"monitoring\" title is duplicated 3 times in the README.md, whilst only one entry should exist. So I believe this change is meaningful regardless the prometheus/grafana decision (it will only affect the existence of that line in the diff, not the change itself).\n\nWouldn\u0027t it be better, If we decided to remove prometheus/grafana, that that piece of documentation will go as part of *that* change instead of blocking this one?",
